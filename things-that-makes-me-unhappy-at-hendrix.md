1. The cutting down of so much of the Hendrix nature preseve. 
The Hendrix nature preserve used to be a beautiful place where you could view flora and fauna in their natural habitat. This changed over the summer break, when most of this was removed in order to make room for woodchips and emptiness on the ground.
2. The tiles on the side of the Creative Quad. While they do remind the students/alumni/donors of Huelen Hall (which used to stand there), the tiles appear to be covered in moss and other plant life. This isn't very asthetically pleasing. 
3. Ella doesn't seem to like to be around people as much this year :(
4. No more late night at the caf
