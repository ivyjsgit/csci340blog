Styling my blog proved a little more difficult than the last assignment. When I was doing step one of this lab, I kept getting unstyled pages when I would save my work. I found out that this is due to the formatter in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) destroying the nicely formatted [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) headers in all the page by putting them on one line.

Jekyll does **not** like this at all, so I had to turn off the formatter on the HTML files.

Anyways, here's some pictures of Tad
