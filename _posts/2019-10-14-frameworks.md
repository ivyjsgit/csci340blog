# Rails
Seems the second most compilcated to learn up front, but seems easy once you do learn that. I like the community aspect of it
but I don't feel like I would choose this framework since I have never used ruby. Ruby appears to have a lot of differences than other languages I've used

# Django
It sounds somewhat easy, however, the routes system looks slightly confusing.
I feel like I could figure it out though. Seems like it has the most complicated file layout apart from Laravel though.

# ASP.net
This one sounds very nice, however, I am not sure I would be able to exclusively use Visual Studio or the Microsoft ecosystem. I don't like being locked into any particular system, but overall this one seems fairly nice to use.

# Express
This sounds somewhat similar to Flask in the sense that it is an extremely lightweight framework.
The caching system seems fairly easy to set up. This framework looks pretty cool, but I would have to look at more examples on usage in order to fully understand it.

# Laravel
This framework seems very popular, but it uses PHP. It is really interesting how they have so many different tutorials on their website.
Most of the installation instructions are for Windows. This seems to be a bit more heavyweight framework.
It seems fairly hard to get set up. It appears to have a lot of up front cost to get set up.
The Blade system seems more complicated than the templating systems of other frameworks.
