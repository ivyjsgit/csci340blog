# Making it work

In order to make an idea or concept that an organization has into production, you need to have a few skills, including realizing client needs, setting realistic timelines, explaining the progress that you have made to non-technical people, and creating a user interface that is understandable to people who have not worked on the project.

The first step in bringing the project to life is meeting with the partner. During the meeting, you need to closely listen to the needs of the client and note down different exactly what is needed to be done, and ask questions when you are not sure how exactly a feature of the project is supposed to function. While you are in the client meeting, you need to think of what is feasible to implement in the time that you have, so that you aren't spending time on certain features that will for sure not be completed by the time you are done.

Once you and your team begin work on the project, you need to be able to prioritize tasks, and schedule things so that you don't have dependency issues of things that need to be implemented after another step. 

After a few weeks, the group has made some progress and it is time to meet with the client again. Here, you have to be able to communicate what you have done and what you are working on in plain English. The client may not know what a database is, or what any other technical words mean, so you have to step back from what you have done and think of what client facing features are complete, and which need to be worked on. 

The client likely won't understand what it means that you have gotten Identities and login redirection working, or that the framework that you are using is hard. Instead, you want to rephrase your response into something such as "We have made it so that when you as the admin log in, it takes you to the correct page. We are still learning the software that we are using to make this, so not everything will work properly right away".

For technology related projects such as these, another related issue comes up. Because the end user aren't the developers of the software, you need to make the software so thatc it is easy to interpret and use. This means studying layouts of existing websites, and spending time demonstrating the software to people who have never seen the software before, and getting opinions on things that you may not have thought about.

Most of my time in the project was spent creating the user interface of the project, and I feel like I did a fairly good job at doing so. While my group was making more and more progress on the project, I worked to tweak things such as making tables display human readable columns, creating error messaging systems, and creating the pleasing login and clock-in and clock-out screens
