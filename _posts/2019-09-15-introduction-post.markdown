I found setting up Jekyll to be relatively easy. However, I came up to a things of note along the way:

1. The MacOS version of Ruby that is installed via XCode Tools cannot be updated past 3.4 via [brew](https://brew.sh). In order to get around this, I had to use [RVM](https://rvm.io), and set it up within ZSH to be able to have an updated enough version of Ruby for Jekyll to run. You must use the version of RVM obtained from the RVM website, since brew doesn't seem to install it properly

2. Markdown is **very easy** to learn, especially if you have experience with Reddit, or any other site that uses markdown for posts/comments.

I am looking forward to seeing how Jekyll can be used to make more than simple static blogs. I didn't have much trouble doing this stuff.
